            <h4>Programmer of the Laser Harp Team</h4>
            <p>Collaborated with a team in order to develop a new software for the University of Rochesterâ€™s Laser Harp in order to improve the proximity of its sound to that one of a harp. With the team, implemented several sound wave testing and comparison tests in order to assimilate the sound as much as possible. Currently, the team is working in creating a more portable platform to make it practical for use in music performances.</p>

            <h3>Modular Robot Centipede (with Transport Applications)</h3>
            <h4>Programmer, Designer, Engineer, Tester, Project Manager</h4>
            <p>Under the guidance of Professor Nelson, the team designed and implemented a modular legged robot transport device inspired by natural centipedes. The robot consists of a head/brain unit containing environmental sensors and guidance and control computation. This is followed by an arbitrary number of leg segment modules, each containing its own power and local control computation, and needing connection only to the unit in front of it. The whole functions somewhat like a legged train. Some of the practical skills that we learned in this course:</p>

            <h3>Why it Works</h3>
            <p>The F-Layout works because it allows web-surfers to scan content naturally. The layout feels comfortable because people have been reading top to bottom, left to right for their entire lives. The implications of this behavioral Layout are something of a double-edged sword though:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>If you need to say something, you absolutely must say it at the top, because...</li>
              <li>Users aren't going to read each and every word on the page. In fact, most readers won't really even bother reading the excerpt of an article. Anything past a headline is probably only going to be there for SEO purposes.</li>
              <li>Images and Headlines are only reliable if they are interesting and engaging.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If this all sounds like you're designing a site more like an advertiser would than a designer, you'd be right. Most sites that rely heavily on the F-Layout also rely on advertising or other "call to action" pitches in the sidebar to drive revenue or some other sort of user-engagement. This isn't necessarily a bad thing (hey, are those advertisements over there on our sidebar?!), but it does underline the relationship between the content and the sidebar... the content is king, the sidebar is usually there to get you involved in something that will take you to another level.</p>

            <p>So what does this mean for a sidebar? An effective relationship between content column and sidebar column in a design will utilize the sidebar in one of two ways:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>To feature "relevant" content. This could be an advertisement, a listing of "related articles", a Social Media widget, etc.</li>
              <li>As a tool for users to find specific content. The obvious example is a searchbar, but it would also be a category listing, a tag cloud, a "popular posts" widget, etc.</li>
            </ol>

          <h2>Caveats Worth Mentioning</h2>
          <p>There are drawbacks to relying too heavily on the "F-Layout" as your design foundation. For one, designs that stick too closely to the F-layout can feel boring and predictable... to combat this, you as a designer will have to bring a certain level of innovation to the table. Well designed sidebar widgets, catchy headlines, and engaging images are all useful tricks, but you'll likely want to take it a step further.</p>
          <p>nce you dip below the top two rows of the "F", it often becomes a challenge to a designer to keep things interesting. I've found that lots of designers sell the top 600px of a site to their clients... this is all fine and well (it is what visitors see first), but the lessons of the F-layout are that it's also important to keep things interesting as you begin to scroll down.</p>
          <p>Just like a song that has one-steady beat might give you a headache, a page can often become dull and repetitive if you don't bother to throw in an interesting element now and again. Breaking the rhythm of a design by limiting repetitious elements is a crucial technique that you'll want to design into your sites to bring your work to the next level. <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-the-f-layout-in-web-design--webdesign-687">Source</a></p>
